## IPv4 Header

### Overview
The **Internet Protocol version 4 Header (IPv4 Header)** is used at **Layer 3** (Network Layer) to facilitate routingâ€”sending data between devices on separate networks, even across the globe via the Internet.

The IPv4 Header **encapsulates** a TCP or UDP segment (Layer 4 PDU). It enables packet forwarding across routers.

**Key Review Points:**
- Minimum Header Length: 20 bytes
- Maximum Header Length: 60 bytes
- Total Packet Size: Up to 65,535 bytes (header + data)

### Header Fields
The IPv4 Header consists of fixed and variable fields. Below is a summary table of all fields:

| Field                  | # of Bits | Description |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Version**           | 4        | Identifies the IP version (IPv4 = 0100 binary / Decimal 4; IPv6 = 0110 binary / Decimal 6). |
| **IHL (Internet Header Length)** | 4 | Specifies header length in 4-byte increments. Minimum: 5 (20 bytes, no options). Maximum: 15 (60 bytes). |
| **DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)** | 6 | Used for Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize delay-sensitive traffic (e.g., voice/video streaming). |
| **ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)** | 2 | Notifies endpoints of network congestion without dropping packets. Requires support from endpoints and infrastructure. |
| **Total Length**      | 16       | Total packet size in bytes (header + data). Minimum: 20 bytes. Maximum: 65,535 bytes (2^16 - 1). |
| **Identification**    | 16       | Identifies fragments of a larger packet for reassembly. Same value across all fragments of one packet. |
| **Flags**             | 3        | Controls fragmentation:<br>- Bit 0: Reserved (always 0).<br>- Bit 1: Don't Fragment (DF) flag.<br>- Bit 2: More Fragments (MF) flag (1 if more fragments; 0 for last/no fragments). |
| **Fragment Offset**   | 13       | Position of this fragment in the original packet (in 8-byte units). Enables out-of-order reassembly. |
| **Time to Live (TTL)** | 8       | Prevents infinite loops by decrementing per hop (router). Drop if TTL=0. Default: 64. Originally in seconds, now hop count. |
| **Protocol**          | 8        | Identifies encapsulated Layer 4 protocol:<br>- 1: ICMP<br>- 6: TCP<br>- 17: UDP<br>- 89: OSPF<br>(See [List of IP Protocol Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers) for more.) |
| **Header Checksum**   | 16       | Error-checking for header only. Recalculated per hop. Data errors handled by encapsulated protocol (e.g., TCP/UDP checksums). |
| **Source Address**    | 32       | IPv4 address of the sender. |
| **Destination Address** | 32     | IPv4 address of the receiver. |
| **Options**           | 0-320    | Variable (rarely used). Present if IHL > 5. Padded to 32-bit boundary. |

**Fragmentation Notes:**
- Occurs if packet > MTU (typically 1500 bytes for Ethernet).
- Fragments are reassembled at the destination host.

## Routing Fundamentals

### What is Routing?
**Routing** is the process routers use to determine the path IP packets take across networks to reach their destination.

- **Routers** maintain a **Routing Table** with known destinations.
- Upon receiving a packet, the router consults the table to forward it via the best path.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Networks spanning large geographic areas (e.g., internet connections between cities).

  <img width="1131" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06d099a-4a2e-41e6-84e8-41df78ed07a8" />

  <img width="1136" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37ed821d-5a35-4339-8450-f05920268929" />

**Routing Methods:**
- **Dynamic Routing**: Routers automatically exchange info using protocols like OSPF to build tables.
- **Static Routing**: Manually configured by admins (no auto-updates).

A **route** instructs the router:
- Forward to **next-hop** IP for destination X.
- Send directly if destination is **directly connected**.
- Process locally if destination is the router's own IP.

**Review: Switching vs. Routing**
- **Switches**: Forward within LANs (Layer 2).
- **Routers**: Forward between LANs/WANs (Layer 3).

### Viewing Routes
To inspect the routing table on a Cisco router (or similar device), use the command:

  ```
    show ip route
  ```

<img width="1140" height="466" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51c1193d-8259-4d56-8cf4-99fa03eebeb7" />


This displays all routes, including codes for route types (e.g., 'C' for connected, 'S' for static). Example output snippet:
  ```
    C    192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0
    S    10.0.0.0/24 [1/0] via 192.168.1.1
  ```

<img width="1136" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1ab0302-7fd4-40b3-9361-97fb3f0be659" />


- Interpret codes: 'C' (Connected), 'S' (Static), 'L' (Local), etc.
- Use `show ip route <network>` for specific routes.

### Route Types
Routing tables include different types of routes, each with distinct purposes and administrative distances (AD) for path selection (lower AD preferred):

| Route Type | Code | Description | Administrative Distance (AD) | Automatic? |
|------------|------|-------------|------------------------------|------------|
| **Connected** | C | Routes to networks directly attached to the router's interfaces. Automatically added upon interface configuration and up/up status. | 0 | Yes |
| **Local** | L | Routes for the router's own IP addresses on interfaces (used for local delivery, e.g., pinging the router itself). Automatically added. | 0 | Yes |
| **Static** | S | Manually configured routes. Do not adapt to topology changes; useful for stable, small networks. | 1 (default; adjustable) | No |

- **Connected vs. Local**: Connected routes point to entire subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24); Local routes are host-specific for the interface's IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1/32).
- **Static vs. Connected/Local**: Statics require manual entry and have higher AD, so they are overridden by connected/local if overlapping.

### Static Routing

Static routes are manually added for simplicity in small/stable networks. They don't adapt to changes (e.g., link failures).

#### Configuration Examples
Static routes can specify a **next-hop IP**, an **exit interface**, or both.

**Basic Static Route (Next-Hop):** `ip route <destination_network> <subnet_mask> <next_hop_ip>`

Example: Route to 192.168.2.0/24 via next-hop 10.0.0.2
  ```
    ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
  ```

**Static Route with Exit Interface:** `ip route <destination_network> <subnet_mask> <exit_interface>`

Example: Route to 192.168.2.0/24 via GigabitEthernet0/1
  ```
    ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 GigabitEthernet0/1
    or
    ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 g0/1
  ```

**Static Route with Both Exit Interface and Next-Hop:** `ip route <destination_network> <subnet_mask> <exit_interface> <next_hop_ip>`

Example: Route to 192.168.2.0/24 via GigabitEthernet0/1 to next-hop 10.0.0.2
  ```
    ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 GigabitEthernet0/1 10.0.0.2
  ```
- **Next-Hop vs. Exit Interface**:
  - **Next-Hop**: Specifies the IP address of the next router to forward the packet to. Requires ARP resolution to find the Layer 2 next-hop MAC. Useful for point-to-point or multi-access networks.
  - **Exit Interface**: Specifies the local outbound interface (e.g., port) to send the packet out. Bypasses ARP for the next-hop; directly uses the interface. Preferred for point-to-point links to avoid recursion.
  - **Both**: Combines them for explicit control (e.g., in multi-access networks); the interface must lead to the next-hop IP.

#### Default Route
A **default route** (0.0.0.0/0) forwards all unmatched traffic to a gateway (e.g., internet router).

**Configuration:** `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next_hop_ip_or_exit_interface>`

**Example:** `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1`

This sends all non-local traffic to the default gateway at 10.0.0.1.
